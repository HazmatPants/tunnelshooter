## TunnelShooter 
> prototype name, will change

An interactive shooter game with a realistic positional damage system. 

Blood volume, blood oxygen, physical work, pain, adrenaline, etc. are all dynamic values that affect each other.

Inspired by [Receiver 2](https://receiver2.com) (gunplay) and [Casualites: Unknown](https://orsonik.itch.io/scav-prototype) (health system).

**This game is in VERY early alpha. There are many bugs and it is very unpolished.**
If you find a bug, please let me know, feedback is greatly appreciated. :D

Check the [releases](https://github.com/HazmatPants/tunnelshooter/releases) for builds.
If you want to play TS with the latest changes, check [EXPORTING.md](EXPORTING.md) for info on how to export the game.
